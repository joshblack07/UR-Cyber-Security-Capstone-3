Exposed Services

Nmap scan results for each machine reveal the below services and OS details:

`nmap -sP 192.168.1.1-255`


`nmap -sV 192.168.1.110`

Due to port 80 being open, we went directly to the website via port 80 (192.168.1.110:80) and discovered that Raven Security is a WordPress Commenter, giving us the clue to run the wordpress scan.
